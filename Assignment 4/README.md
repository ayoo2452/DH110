## Introduction: Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling is an important step in empathizing with potential users, and for brainstorming ideas on how certain users may need/want to utilize your product. By creating personas and journey maps, we can better orient ourselves to see our product through the eyes of a user and identify different problem-solving avenues. In general, UX storytelling and personas in particular allow us to consider accessibility issues and posit design solutions by examining realistic cases and situations that might entail the use (or dismissal) of a product. For this project, I utilize UX storytelling for all the aforementioned reasons, as well as for the additional benefit of hypothesizing a multi-faceted platform that users with various goals can utilize.

## Tasks  
- **Task One:** Organize a discrete/non-continuous route with multiple stops (i.e. destinations), and to compare public transport lines/systems with ease. Additionally, users should be able to get notifications when their bus/transit is approaching and/or heading towards their listed destination is nearby. Note that this route finder will exclusively be used for public transportation systems within Los Angeles. 

  > This task is intended to be the main focus/draw of the mobile version of this product

- **Task Two:** Find public services and/or community events with ease, and highly relevant filters (e.g. by location, date/time, type of service). Additionally, users should be able to share the events they find, create a curated list of events, and make use of the navigation system to pre-set routes that can also be shared/exported to different file formats. 

  > This is intended to be the main focus/draw of the desktop version of this product.

### Persona + Empathy Map

### Scenario

1. Why is Taylor using this app/site?
> Taylor(they/them) is a first-year graduate student at UCLA studying molecular biology. They are almost always buried in their assignments and time-sensitive lab work, both of which are physically and mentally taxing after an extended period with little to no breaks. In a (slightly uncharacteristic) bout of generosity, Taylor's supervisor announced that they could take the day off on Halloween (Monday, Oct. 31). Taylor— an out of state student who grew up in Oregon is extremely excited to get a chance to explore Los Angeles recreationally. They do have a car that they could use to navigate through West LA and beyond, but they don't want to have to worry about gas prices and potential parking issues/payments depending on where they go. 

> Taylor was never a big user of the public transport back in their hometown Oregon, so they are relatiively unfamiliar with public transit, and even less so in Los Angeles. With a few destinations in mind (The Grove, LACMA, and the Academy Museum), Taylor uses Google Maps to look up the respective routes that they could take via public transit (in this case, assume public transit is limited to bus systems). They are immediately met with a variety of lines they could take, some requiring a bus transfer, and others not. They continue to browse bus options, and also find that the route options vary in how much walking (e.g. to the connecting stop) they require. As written in the persona, Taylor has knee issues and cannot stand nor walk excessive distances. Taylor is now at a loss, and is confused on how they know which bus to take— depending on the time, availability, comfortability, and walking they require. They're also unsure of how to navigate the bus once they enter it-- that is, they are not sure how to pay for the bus or how to indicate to the bus driver when to stop.

2. How does Taylor use this app/site? 
> Taylor finds our app (tentative name connectLA), and launches the app as a guest user (instead of selecting the Login/Login using Google account options). They land on our home page, and immediately navigate to the “Search route” feature, which then prompts them to enter their destination. Taylor first inputs “The Grove" as their destination, but then notices that they can also add multiple other destinations to their route. They then enter “LACMA” and “The Academy Museum” as additional stops, before turning on the "Sort by distance" feature. The app then sorts the destinations in order of distance from Taylor’s current location. Next, Taylor filters the route options to “Bus Only”, resulting in a few options with various bus lines. 

> There are also other filters, including a filter by bus line (e.g. Big Blue Blue only), but Taylor does not know enough to prefer one line over another.  Since there are multiple routes to choose from, Taylor clicks on the "Compare route" feature, which allows one to compare 2 routes at a time. Upon clicking on the “Compare route” feature, Taylor can see how the bus lines compare in running time, number of line changes, distance to walk from bus stop to destination (in time and distance), estimated capacity (i.e. how busy the bus is), and likelihood of delay (based on past rates of delay). Taylor can now make better sense of which line works better for them, and uses this to guide their selection. 

> After choosing their route, Taylor heads towards their respective bus stop. On the app, the estimated arrival time for the bus appears on the home/landing screen. If the bus was running early or late, Taylor would have received a notification. Upon arriving at their first destination, Taylor confirms that they have arrived at their first stop, and inputs their estimated time that they want to head to their next location. The app then sends Taylor a notification, 20 minutes before that estimated departure time, then prompting them to choose a route. The timed notification can be adjusted to notify the user an X number of minutes before the bus arrives. Using this app, Taylor is able to continuously compare the routes they can take home, while also receiving periodical notifications so they don’t miss a stop and/or connecting bus. This alleviates Taylor's cognitive effort, while also keeping them informed on the status of their transportation.

### Persona + Empathy Map

### Scenario

1. Why is Kimia using this app/site? 
> Kimia is a primary/elementary school principal in Koreatown,CA. Ever since she was in college, Kimia knew that she wanted to be involved in elementary education and also wanted to build a tight-knit, supportive community between parents, students, faculty, and staff members at her school. When sending her bi-weekly principal updates via digital newsletter (from an email list), Kimia also includes a list of nearby activities and services available for free and/or at reduced/limited cost to Los Angeles citizens. She provides these resources for students' parents, who may require assistance in varying subsets of needs. Kimia wants to provide the most accurate and updated information to her parents, but has found that finding relevant resources/nearby events and linking them within her newsletters to be more time-consuming and frustrating than it needs to be. Additionally, Kimia wants to map out basic routes that others can take to reach the in-person city service centers— e.g. routes going to or from her school. Kimia also believes that spreading goodwill and well-intended information should be easy and effortless, so she is really looking for a platform where she can find and share philanthropic resources with ease.

2. How is Kimia using this app/site?
> Kimia uses the desktop version of our product, which immediately takes her to a landing page. The main page highlights the (public transit) route finder, but also features the “City Resources” on that same page. She navigates to the “City Resources” tab, which shows a list of available services and resources, all of which are divided into different categories. Upon hovering over the category names and icons, a small pop-up window appears with a blurb on the category description. In addition to selecting one of the pre-set categories, Kimia can also browse by different criteria, such as by date or by distance from a given location.

> Kimia browses the options available within a 5 mile radius of her school (in Koreatown, CA). The results are displayed in list format, though they can be toggled to appear as a grid, with three results per row. Upon finding resources that catch her eye, she saves them by pressing the “Save Item” button, which then adds that resource entry into a list of past saved entries. This list of entries/items can be accessed by selecting the “My Account” tab, then navigating to the sub-page of “Saved Items”. 

> When Kimia selects an item (where “item” is the entry containing information on a given event/resource), there is an embedded, interactive route finder. Similar in design to the main route finder on the front page, Kimia can automatically find the available public transit lines that will take the user from the input location (e.g. Kimia’s school) to that entry/service center’s address. She can then export and/or share that specific route in a format that can be embedded or linked in an email.

## Reflection
- Using UX storytelling was really helpful in clarifying my intentions with this project, as well as re-orienting the direction that I want this app to take. 
- I also found it unexpectedly difficult to come up with detailed personas. One of the main goals of building personas is to step away from your personal perspective and step into the shoes of a certain kind of user, but I don't know that I can truly remove myself and any implicit biases from this process, as I myself am the creator of this persona.
