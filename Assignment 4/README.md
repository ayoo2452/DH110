## Introduction: Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling is an important step in empathizing with potential users, and for brainstorming ideas on how certain users may need/want to utilize your product. By creating personas and journey maps, we can better orient ourselves to see our product through the eyes of a user and identify different problem-solving avenues. In general, UX storytelling and personas in particular allow us to consider accessibility issues and posit design solutions by examining realistic cases and situations that might entail the use (or dismissal) of a product. For this project, I utilize UX storytelling for all the aforementioned reasons, as well as for the additional benefit of hypothesizing a multi-faceted platform that users with various goals can utilize.

## Tasks 
Two tasks you want to propose for the ux design

### Persona + Empathy Map

### Scenario

1. Why is Taylor using this app/site?
> Taylor(they/them) is a graduate student at UCLA studying molecular biology. They are almost always buried in their assignments and time-sensitive lab work, both of which are physically and mentally taxing after an extended period with little to no breaks. In a (slightly uncharacteristic) bout of generosity, Taylor's supervisor announced that they could take the day off on Halloween (Monday, Oct. 31). Taylor— an out of state student who grew up in BLANK is extremely excited to get a chance to explore Los Angeles recreationally. They do have a car that they could use to navigate through West LA and beyond, but they don't want to have to worry about gas prices and potential parking issues/payments depending on where they go. 

> Taylor was never a big user of the public transport back in their hometown BLANK, so they are relatiively unfamiliar with public transit, and even less so in Los Angeles. With a few destinations in mind, Taylor uses Google Maps to look up the respective routes that they could take via public transit (in this case, assume public transit is limited to bus systems). They are immediately met with a variety of lines they could take, some requiring a bus transfer, and others not. They continue to browse bus options, and also find that the route options vary in how much walking (e.g. to the connecting stop) they require. As written in the persona, Taylor has knee issues and cannot stand nor walk excessive distances. Taylor is now at a loss, and is confused on how they know which bus to take— depending on the time, availability, comfortability, and walking they require. They're also unsure of how to navigate the bus once they enter it-- that is, they are not sure how to pay for the bus or how to indicate to the bus driver when to stop.

2. How does Taylor use this app/site? 
> Taylor finds our app (tentative name connectLA), and navigates to the “Search route” feature, which then prompts them to enter their destination. Taylor inputs “The Grove”, and then enters “LACMA” and “The Academy Museum” as additional stops. The app automatically sorts the destinations in order of distance from Taylor’s current location. Next, Taylor filters the route options to “Bus Only”, resulting in a few options with various bus lines. Upon clicking on the “Compare route” feature, Taylor can see how the bus lines compare in running time, number of line changes, distance to walk from bus stop to destination, estimated capacity, and likelihood of delay. Taylor can now make better sense of which line works better for them, and uses this to guide their selection. 
> After choosing their route, Taylor heads towards their respective bus stop. Upon arriving at their first destination, Taylor confirms that they have arrived at their first stop, and inputs their estimated time that they want to head to their next location. The app then sends Taylor a notification 20 minutes before that estimated departure time, prompting them to choose a route (or “Snooze Request”). Using this app, Taylor is able to continuously compare the routes they can take home, while also receiving periodical notifications so they don’t miss a stop and/or connecting bus.

## Persona 2: Kimia Lee (Images: [Google Drive Ver.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SAU-YB3vyxjTszdIJb_A6HcP_nkYHt7f?usp=sharing))

### Scenario

1. Why is Kimia using this app/site? 
> Kimia is a primary/elementary school principal in Koreatown,CA. Ever since she was in college, Kimia knew that she wanted to be involved in elementary education and also wanted to build a tight-knit, supportive community between parents, students, faculty, and staff members at her school. When sending her bi-weekly principal updates via digital newsletter (from an email list), Kimia also includes a list of nearby activities and services available for free and/or at reduced/limited cost to Los Angeles citizens. She provides these resources for students' parents, who may require assistance in varying subsets of needs. Kimia wants to provide the most accurate and updated information to her parents, but has found that finding relevant resources/nearby events and linking them within her newsletters to be more time-consuming and frustrating than it needs to be. Additionally, Kimia wants to map out basic routes that others can take to reach the in-person city service centers— e.g. routes going to or from her school. Kimia also believes that spreading goodwill and well-intended information should be easy and effortless, so she is really looking for a platform where she can find and share philanthropic resources with ease.

2. How is Kimia using this app/site?
> Kimia finds the desktop version of our product, and toggles to the “City Resources” tab, which shows a list of available services and resources, all of which are divided into different categories. She finds that she can also browse by different criteria, such as by date or by distance from a given location. Entering her address (Koreatown, CA), Kimia browses the options available within a 5 mile radius of her school. Upon finding resources that catch her eye, she saves them by pressing the “Save entry” button, which then adds that resource entry into a list of past saved entries. Additionally, Kimia finds that she can automatically route from an input location to that entry’s address. She can then export and/or share the route in a format that can be embedded or linked in an email. 
> Kimia continues to browse our desktop site for organizations, events, and more resources. She filters the results based on dates of availability, distance from her school, and by category. As she’s been providing newsletters for a while and receiving feedback from parents, she generally knows what categories her community is interested in— though she will always add extra resources out of consideration. Each time she finds an entry she likes, Kimia adds it to her Saved Entries list, which she can later export in its entirety, either as a PDF or text with hyperlinks enabled. Additionally, Kimia makes sure to set the route section to depart from her school. Exporting the entries with routes will also export links that direct users to our app/site, with the pre-set route being automatically generated. By using this desktop site, Kimia is able to expedite her compilation of resources that help her better serve her community.
