## Introduction: Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling is an important step in empathizing with potential users, and for brainstorming ideas on how certain users may need/want to utilize your product. By creating personas and journey maps, we can better orient ourselves to see our product through the eyes of a user and identify different problem-solving avenues. In general, UX storytelling and personas in particular allow us to consider accessibility issues and posit design solutions by examining realistic cases and situations that might entail the use (or dismissal) of a product. For this project, I utilize UX storytelling for all the aforementioned reasons, as well as for the additional benefit of hypothesizing a multi-faceted platform that users with various goals can utilize.
