## :small_blue_diamond: Project Description
Research goal & requirements

Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.31-33)
What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?

Step02: Target users (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.44-51)
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 

## :small_blue_diamond: Research Method + Plans

Step03: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 
by covert / overt observation
by active / passive / participatory interaction * 
Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.39-42)

## :small_blue_diamond: Interview Guide/Script

Step04: Plan the details
Brainstorm the right contexts and narrow down to decide where to visit physically and/or virtually (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.52-55)
Decide what activities to observe
Decide how to interact with the users (ex. overt x participatory if it is contextual inquiry)
Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)
Prepare the (interview + observation) guide (p.41)

Step05: Conduct the research
