### Research goal & requirements

Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.31-33)\

**1. What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**
This project aims to support the main activity of planning routes and transportation methods to a given destination in Los Angeles, all while identifying sustainability factors such as fuel-efficiency and eco-friendly options. It also aims to support the secondary issue of troubleshooting traffic-related issues such as reporting traffic due to construction, illegally parked cars, and civic technical issues (e.g. broken traffic lights). Note that this project limits itself to Los Angeles-specific issues due to our highly dense population and the specialized issues and/or solutions that can arise from our unique location and culture.

**2. What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
This activity is necessary because many citizens— not just Los Angeles citizens— rely on GPS or other navigation devices to route themselves, and often require assistance in deciding not only how to go some place, but by what means (e.g. public transportation, personal car, etc). Los Angeles is known for having difficult-to-navigate public transportation, thereby creating the basic need/goal to organize what bus or Metro lines to take, and how much time you should allot to round-trips on public transport.

In terms of [Maslow’s hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs), the basic needs involved here are safety and personal security (also a part of the greater branch of safety). This is because transportation and navigation are key in meeting a person’s safety needs (e.g. it is dangerous to walk around or get lost at night). Additionally, I intend to incorporate features that show more environmentally-friendly transportation options, which can help meet the need of self-esteem (resulting from choosing a more sustainable option, which is widely hailed as an intelligent and conscientious move) as well as a sense of belonging, since eco-friendly options are of high public interest at the moment [(Source: “The Rise of the](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-rise-of-the-eco-friendly-consumer)). 

**3. What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**

To currently satisfy the need of navigation, Los Angeles users typically turn to Google Maps or Apple Maps to route themselves, be that when they drive themselves or when they attempt to use public transportation. In a survey study by United Tires, 93% of “respondents said they were dependent on their GPS and 1 in 5 use it every day”, while “83% of respondents said they would get lost without their GPS” ([Source: United Tires](https://www.utires.com/articles/where-drivers-need-gps-the-most/)).

As for finding assistance with street- or traffic-related issues, users will typically look up solutions these issues individually online. For example, someone who wants to report illegally parked cars will likely run a general search on tow trucks in the area, rather than having a go-to site for this kind of issue. 

**4. What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**

While Google maps and Apple maps— the two most popular navigation systems amongst respondents in the United Tires study— offer information on public transport systems and what is available at the time of search, they do not allow users to plan a day’s worth of routes ahead of time. For example, say that I wanted to visit Santa Monica and Koreatown in one day, all while utilizing public transport. Google Maps would let me look up routes to Santa Monica and Koreatown individually, but it would be difficult for me to coordinate and save the times and exact stops that I intend to utilize while riding public transportation systems. In other words, we could improve coordination with bus system information by allowing users to specify when and for how long they intend to visit a place, as well as the bus timing/intervals that they need to be aware of around their intended time of arrival/departure. 

### Target users (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.44-51)

**1. What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)**\
- Demographics:
    - Students, workers, adults
    - Living in Los Angeles
    - Relies on some degree of automobile transportation
    - Has access to a smartphone or internet (for app/website access)
- Preference:
    - Relies on navigation systems like Google Maps or Apple Maps
    - Utilizes or is open to using various modes of transport (ex. driving their own car, using the bus/Metro system)
- Expertise: Target users may have any level of expertise in navigation, transportation, and tech literacy/familiarity.
- The project solution is targeted at mainstream users, though I will strive to research and accommodate more extreme cases as I iterate through the design process.

**2. In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**\
- Where: 
    - Anywhere the user has access to the app/website and Wi-Fi/cellular data. Examples include home, at a restaurant, in a moving vehicle,
- Why: 
    - To report traffic and/or street issues (ex. broken street lights or illegally parked cars)
    - To explore transportation options to a given destination, while also noting traveling time and mileage
    - To plan projected routes ahead of time and/or at the time of intended departure
- Which conditions:
    - When users require additional information on transport or infrastructure issues, amongst other traffic-related concerns
    - The main activity of planning routes and/or finding information on transportation related services should NOT be used in the condition of an emergency. This potential app/site that I intend to design is NOT for emergency purposes. 
        
**3. What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**\

*Given services currently available and popular:

- Users would usually use Google Maps, Apple Maps, or their car navigation to look at routes and estimated traveling time.
- To report or troubleshoot traffic issues, they might research their question or concern on the internet and browse until they find the most suitable and/or relevant site for their query.

## :small_blue_diamond: Research Method

- I have chosen to utilize the participant interview research method. At Professor Cho’s approval, I interviewed participants about their experiences in navigation and residing in Los Angeles, as it was not plausible to follow around strangers who own a car and/or ask to be driven around. Though typically terminology might not apply here, my research method can be roughly categorized as overt (as participants knew I was a researcher) and passive (I did not interfere with their answers to the hypothetical activities posited).
- To get a more accurate representation of my target user, I found two participants at different UCLA parking structures. Labeled Participant A and Participant B, they parked at UCLA Parking Structures #8 and #7, respectively, and are UCLA undergraduate students. Both participants just finished driving prior to our interview.
    - Note that Participant B’s interview was conducted at a private space in the UCLA Student Media building, due to excess noise in Parking Lot 7.
- Data collection
    - Method: Audio recording
    - Tools used:
        - Audio was recorded through [Otter.ai](http://Otter.ai) on an iPad Pro. An additional back-up recording was made on an iPhone XR, via Apple’s default Recordings app
        - Participant A connected their AirPods to the recording device (iPad Pro) at their own request— they stated that they felt more comfortable and less awkward speaking when they have some microphone near them.

*Note: The recording on my iPad Pro cut off about 80% of the way through my interview with Participant A, so I had to use the back-up audio recorded on my iPhone XR. The iPhone XR audio contains the Participant A interview, but is missing my introduction to the interview.

+1: Insights from data
+1: Lesson learned

This interview experience was extremely insightful to the user research process, as well as to my project in particular. I found that my participants were relatively talkative, making for great conversation and a fruitful interview. However, upon looking back at my transcript, I feel that I could have expanded further on certain topics that my participants brought up in their answers. That is, I see— in hindsight— that there are some follow-up questions that I should have or would have liked to ask. Since I am still relatively new to interviewing users, I felt a greater need to stick to my script instead of letting a natural conversation flow. While sticking to the script has its benefits, especially in terms of consistency, I feel that each user deserves a more in-depth discussion when their responses prompt it, and I'll improve moving forward by slowing down a bit in my interview process to really ensure I fully understand and expand upon my participants' answers.
