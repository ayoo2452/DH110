## :small_blue_diamond: Project Description
### Research goal & requirements
Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.31-33)\

**1. What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**\
This project aims to support the main activity of planning routes and transportation methods to a given destination in Los Angeles, all while identifying sustainability factors such as fuel-efficiency and eco-friendly options. It also aims to support the secondary issue of troubleshooting traffic-related issues such as reporting traffic due to construction, illegally parked cars, and civic technical issues (e.g. broken traffic lights). Note that this project limits itself to Los Angeles-specific issues due to our highly dense population and the specialized issues and/or solutions that can arise from our unique location and culture. 

**2. What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)**\
This activity is necessary because many citizensâ€” not just Los Angeles citizensâ€” rely on GPS or other navigation devices to route themselves, and often require assistance in deciding not only how to go some place, but by what means (e.g. public transportation, personal car, etc). Los Angeles is known for having difficult-to-navigate public transportation, thereby creating the basic need/goal to organize what bus or Metro lines to take, and how much time you should allot to round-trips on public transport.   

**3. What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**\
**4. What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**

### Target users (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.44-51)
**1. What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)**\
**2. In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**\ 
**3. What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**\

## :small_blue_diamond: Research Method + Plans

Step03: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 
by covert / overt observation
by active / passive / participatory interaction * 
Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.39-42)

## :small_blue_diamond: Interview Guide/Script

[Interview Guide Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GGkm1xfr-2ujvXvhCqpXRNmkW0pxDSDwYxur1dNQg0k/edit?usp=sharing)\
*Please note that some parts may have been paraphrased based on the participantsâ€™ answers for conversation fluidity. Additionally, I asked a few follow-up questions based on the participantsâ€™ answers, as seen in the transcript.*

Step04: Plan the details
Brainstorm the right contexts and narrow down to decide where to visit physically and/or virtually (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.52-55)
Decide what activities to observe
Decide how to interact with the users (ex. overt x participatory if it is contextual inquiry)
Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)
Prepare the (interview + observation) guide (p.41)

Step05: Conduct the research
Contact, schedule, and visit the place
Meet/Observe people/person, follow the interview guide you prepared
Collect/Record the data, make a notes

Step06: Organize/Documentation
In github (sub)repository of this assignment, create one document (either README.md or .html)
Describe your research goal and requirement/constraints + target user (step1+2)
Describe your research methods and plan (step3)
Provide a link to your interview/observation guide (step4) 
Digitize your notes (scan/photo) and upload your data to github
Provide a link to your representative data file(s) (step5)
Provide a link to the transcript of your interview (or meaningful dialogues/ talk-alouds during observation) 
Write a reflection
