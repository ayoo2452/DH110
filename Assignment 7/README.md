# Assignment 7: High-fidelity prototype

## üîπ¬†Project background

### Description

My project is largely an unsolicited redesign of the MyLA311 app, a mobile app created and maintained by the City of Los Angeles. The purpose of this app is to allow LA residents to request and/or browse available city services, as well as track the status of past/pending service requests. Additionally, my redesign aims to solve the UN Sustainability Goal of Sustainable Communities/Cities by including community resources and navigation specific to LA public transit. The goal of my project is to create an easy-to-use, informative, and intuitive platform where LA residents can easily find resources, services, and routes to navigate life in the sprawling city of Los Angeles. 

### Purpose + Process of interactive prototype

The purpose of creating an interactive prototype is to fully visualize the user flow for all the tasks and supporting frames/overlays that our design intends to incorporate. High fidelity prototypes are essential for walking through our designs, while demonstrating how frames will connect with each other and visualizing the sequence of steps to take in order to accomplish a given task. The process of creating a high-fidelity prototype is‚Äî as most steps in the UX design process‚Äî extremely iterative. Building this high-fidelity prototype involved me editing my design system created in Assignment 06 and required me to constantly brainstorm how to best visualize certain affordances and/or layouts for my design. In making the move from low- to high-fidelity prototypes, I implemented graphic design elements (colour, typography, etc) to the low-fi user interface and continuously iterated my designs as the high-fidelity wireframes came together. After editing these designs, I added interactions between frames (via Figma‚Äôs prototyping tools) in order to display how frames should connect with each other.

## üîπ**Tasks**

1. Choose a route from UCLA/current location to The Grove, with an intermediate stop at Westfield Century City. Sort the order of your destinations for efficiency, and compare the routes (at least, for the first stop). Select a route for each stop, and proceed with your navigation.
2. Browse all resources on the app, and select one that catches your eye. Save the resource to your list of resources, then export/share that resource. For this prototype, I‚Äôve chosen to have the prototype support the specific task of ‚Äúexport as a CSV‚Äù, but the share window pop-up indicates other options. 
3. Submit a city service request by following the guided procedure. Review and receive confirmation of the submitted request.

## üîπ¬†Cognitive walk through

*Note: The cognitive walk through from class (11/16) was done on my hi-fi prototype draft, as I received an extension due to health reasons. The commentary from my peers reflects the state of my draft on 11/16, in which I shared the majority of my hi-fi frames, with most lacking interaction.*

### Evidence of walkthrough:

Please visit this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BjTScrS-OgvEXPq3CxHwnBneATIuitBvhHyCjlBSwxU/edit?usp=sharing) with my partners‚Äô Google Form feedback on my designs. 

### Summary - Major takeaways

1. The current design seems to rely on subtitles and/or written information. This may be a weak point for users who rely more on visual cues to quickly navigate the page. Try to emphasize key features using more contrasting colours and/or sizing. 
2. Similarly to point #1: Users utilize layout as a clue on what certain features are capable of and/or what certain visual assets afford. 
3. The tracking bar on the ‚Äúsubmit a service request‚Äù section is really useful. Consider implementing more ‚Äútracking‚Äù features throughout each sector of the app, and in the earliest stages of a process. 
4. Users would benefit from seeing more information on what to expect after submitting a request (E.g. How long till they get a response? Will they get a confirmation email?) 
5. The app has a professional, clean feel to it. Reviewer B noted that the app is consistent in aesthetic, colouring, and layout.
