# Assignment 5: Low-Fi Prototype

##  :small_blue_diamond: Description 
### Purpose 
The purpose of this low-fi prototype is to create a working model of my proposed design solutions for the issues and pain points with MyLA311 that were identified throughout my heuristic evaluation and user research. Low-fidelity prototypes are incredible important to the UX design process, as they allow us to understand how users will interact with our potential design solutions. Additionally, low-fi designs are presented as an intermediate measure of our designsâ€™ efficacy, allowing us to catch errors, miscommunications, or user mis-use earlier in the design process. 

In particular, this project aims to remedy issues with browsing ability and a lack of cohesive resource information on MyLA311.  Additionally, this low-fi prototype incorporates design solutions to make coordinating routes via public transit easier and less cognitively intensive for users (especially those unfamiliar with LA public transit). To re-orient the course of my project, I created 2 personas to guide my design thinking: 

> Persona 1 = A primary school principal looking to easily find, compile, and export information on resources available to her community. She's also interested in routing via public transport to in-person service centers from relevant locations (in her case, her primary school).
> 
> Persona 2 = A graduate student at UCLA looking to get around LA for cheap, but has limited knowledge in public transportation. Does not like the extra cognitive effort that managing/keeping track of their route public transport requires. 

Upon imagining realistic usage scenarios for both users (information on which can be found in [Assignment 4: Personas and Scenarios](https://github.com/ayoo2452/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%204)), I identified three features of interest for the redesign of MyLA311: 

1. A route-finder with information specific and tailored to LA Public Transit (not just the Metro, but including other public transport services that serve the greater Los Angeles County area). This navigation should ease cognitive load, and provide enough information on the different lines/systems so that first time users understand their options sufficiently. 
2. A cohesive, easily browse-able directory of resources available to the community. This should support efficient and relevant filtering, as well as ways to easily compile and/or save resources of high interest to the user. 
3. Re-organize and address error verification issues with the Submit a Request function on MyLA311 app. (This particular features stems from my heuristic evaluation of MyLA311's app, andâ€” more recently-- a deeper evaluation at MyLA311's website).

For this assignment in particular, I tested focus points #1 and #2, as these are the issues that align with the scenarios presented in [Assignment 4: Personas and Scenarios](https://github.com/ayoo2452/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%204). However, note the rough wireframes for Service Requests in the Wireframes and/or Wireflow sections below. 

### Tasks
1. Choose a route from UCLA/current location to The Grove, with an intermediate stop at Westfield Century City. Sort the order of your destinations for efficiency, and compare the routes. Make a decision (on your route) based on the available factors. 
2. Browse all resources on the app, and save one that catches your eye. Then, view all your saved resources, and share that list as a PDF for easy distribution.

##  :small_blue_diamond: User Testing

> NOTE 1 : All photos were taken _before_ the participant started on their wireflowsâ€” we both agreed that having a camera on during the process might be burdensome. Additionally, the picture of the participant on the "Services" pages/frames was taken as I introduced the general idea of how I wanted their hypothetical wireflow to be drawn. I used the services page as an example, since neither of the assigned tasks pertained to that section.

> NOTE 2: Wireframes created in Figma. Tested and annotated by participant in GoodNotes, using an iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil (2nd generation).

## ðŸ’¡ Reflection 

### Notes on participant's chosen pathway and testing

- The participant was able to complete both tasks without much difficulty. However, they did take significantly longer to complete Task One (route finding) than Task Two (Saving a resource).
- Participant was not very vocal in their thought process, resulting in limited internal insight. Additionally, they conveyed that their actions/pathway decisions were based on intuition, which are difficult to articulate. 
- In the login page, the user chose "Continue as guest", but then proceeded to the "Register" frames. The intent for "Continnue as guest" was so that the user did not have to input any information about themselves into the system, and instead go straight to the "What can we help with" frame. I found this to be very interesting, and made me realize how my own biases played into setting my expectations for my wireframes. I would also like to test these frames again, and write "Continue without signing in" instead of "Continue as guest". This might set an expectation that the user won't be logging in, which in turn would make arriving at the "Register" page unnatural/less likely. 
- The frames that corresponded with Task 1 (route/navigation) were lacking in signifiers, and will most definitely be improved on as we move to mid- and high-fidelity designs). However, the user was able to complete the task without difficulty, implying a strong tech fluency that should be considered as I move forward in the design process. (That is, I should be considerate of the fact that my participant was highly profficient in using technology, so not all design flaws have been addressed). 
- User was briefly confused with the different share buttons/icons during Task 2. Should consider what icon is more common in the LA County area, as the differences in familiarity with this particular icon result from the users' mobile device (iOS devices versus Android).

- **What went well**
  - User was able to complete both tasks 
  - Minor confusion (e.g. icon recognition), but nothing that prevented the task from being completed 
  - Obtained insight on phrasing for "Continue as a guest"

- **Ways to improve testing procedures**
  - Ask more follow-up questions. I'm still new to being a researcher/moderator, so it's quite difficult to quickly think of conductive questions that aren't too leading 
  - Space out the wireframes more to make pathways clearer (also, for more space for me to annotate the participant's areas of confusion and/or insight)

### Main areas to improve the prototype

1. **Changing the "Continue as guest" to say "Continue without logging in" instead.** When forming their pathway, my participant went from the login screen (options: Login, Register, Continue as guest), clicked "Continue as guest", but then directed themselves to the "Register" page. They were of the belief that "Continue as guest" meant that you'd eventually have to log in/sign up, thus leading them to designate the "Register" page as the next step. I aim to ammend this issue by writing "Continue without logging in", which should reassure the user that they will not be providing personal information--  unless they choose to request a service that requires personal contact information (ex. filing a complaint about a private property).

2. **Adding more signifiers and significantly more detail to the navigation portion of the app.** Though my user didn't have a large issue with completing Task 1, I definitely noticed them wavering and hesitating when directing their user-flow. I personally think this feature is going to need significant upgrades, which is what I will be working on in the next week as we shift to high-fidelity design. In particular, I want to add more data points for the users to utilize as they compare buses (ex. how busy the bus is at that hour). Additionally, I intend to research more on ways to alleviate the cognitive load on users following a bus navigation. I think that making use of notifications that utilize different modalities to alert the user will be especially helpful. For instance, having a phone vibrate when nearing a stop is helpful to a user who may be overwhelmed with visual stimuli. 

3. **Enhancing the filter and sort-by functions for all three portions (Navigation, Services, Resources)**. This goal isn't spurned by my participant's experience, but accessibility of information comes from the ease of acquiring it, so I hope to better support browsing functionality in all three feature sectors of my proposed app. In particular, I think filtering will be important for Resource browsing, as many people are looking for specific events and/or services for their specific circumstances. 


### Reflection on low-fidelity prototypes: 

Low-fidelity prototypes are incredibly insightful and a great means to orient a design team in their path towards innovative, useful products. I certaintly felt this throughout my assignment, as wireframing really helped me lay out all my ideas and see how they might operate as a cohesive unit. This assignment poked several holes in my proposed design, so I'm both daunted and excited to know how much more I will be iterating on my current designs.
