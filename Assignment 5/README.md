# Assignment 5: Low-Fi Prototype

##  :small_blue_diamond: Description 
### Purpose 
The purpose of this low-fi prototype is to create a working model of my proposed design solutions for the issues and pain points with MyLA311 that were identified throughout my heuristic evaluation and user research. Low-fidelity prototypes are incredible important to the UX design process, as they allow us to understand how users will interact with our potential design solutions. Additionally, low-fi designs are presented as an intermediate measure of our designs’ efficacy, allowing us to catch errors, miscommunications, or user mis-use earlier in the design process. 

In particular, this project aims to remedy issues with browsing ability and a lack of cohesive resource information on MyLA311.  Additionally, this low-fi prototype incorporates design solutions to make coordinating routes via public transit easier and less cognitively intensive for users (especially those unfamiliar with LA public transit). To re-orient the course of my project, I created 2 personas to guide my design thinking: 

> Persona 1 = A primary school principal looking to easily find, compile, and export information on resources available to her community. She's also interested in routing via public transport to in-person service centers from relevant locations (in her case, her primary school).
> 
> Persona 2 = A graduate student at UCLA looking to get around LA for cheap, but has limited knowledge in public transportation. Does not like the extra cognitive effort that managing/keeping track of their route public transport requires. 

Upon imagining realistic usage scenarios for both users (information on which can be found in [Assignment 4: Personas and Scenarios](https://github.com/ayoo2452/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%204)), I identified three features of interest for the redesign of MyLA311: 

1. A route-finder with information specific and tailored to LA Public Transit (not just the Metro, but including other public transport services that serve the greater Los Angeles County area). This navigation should ease cognitive load, and provide enough information on the different lines/systems so that first time users understand their options sufficiently. 
2. A cohesive, easily browse-able directory of resources available to the community. This should support efficient and relevant filtering, as well as ways to easily compile and/or save resources of high interest to the user. 
3. Re-organize and address error verification issues with the Submit a Request function on MyLA311 app. (This particular features stems from my heuristic evaluation of MyLA311's app, and— more recently-- a deeper evaluation at MyLA311's website).

For this assignment in particular, I tested focus points #1 and #2, as these are the issues that align with the scenarios presented in [Assignment 4: Personas and Scenarios](https://github.com/ayoo2452/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%204). However, note the rough wireframes for Service Requests in the Wireframes and/or Wireflow sections below.

##  :small_blue_diamond: User Testing

> NOTE: All photos were taken _before_ the participant started on their wireflows— we both agreed that having a camera on during the process might be burdensome. Additionally, the picture of the participant on the "Services" pages/frames was taken as I introduced the general idea of how I wanted their hypothetical wireflow to be drawn. I used the services page as an example, since neither of the assigned tasks pertained to that section.

|  Services page | Resources (Task 2) | Find a route (Task 1) |
