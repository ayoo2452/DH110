# Assignment 5: Low-Fi Prototype

##  :small_blue_diamond: Description 
### Purpose 
The purpose of this low-fi prototype is to create a working model of my proposed design solutions for the issues and pain points with MyLA311 that were identified throughout my heuristic evaluation and user research. Additionally, this low-fi prototype incorporates design solutions to make coordinating routes via public transit easier and less cognitively intensive for users (especially those unfamiliar with LA public transit).
