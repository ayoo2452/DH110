## DH110 Fall 2022 | Alex Yoo | Topic: Sustainable Cities and Communities
# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

**Project Description**
Just as sustainable communities depend on proper environmental regulation, the daily circumstances of citizens are equally relevant and should be thoroughly accounted for and supported by their respective local governments. In line with this effort are My311LA (website and mobile app) and 211LA.org, both of which serve the greater Los Angeles population by providing information and/or support on local economic, domestic, and navigational resources. My project this quarter is to redesign the My311LA app with easy usability and high accessibility, while also drawing inspiration from 211LA.org site. As a whole, this project reflects the UN's Sustainable Community and Cities goal (SDG #11) as it will serve as a uniting resource to help LA citizens better make use of available resources while highlighting a need for new resources


## **Overview of Neilsen Heuristics**

| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | Users should always be informed about what is going on and should be given appropriate feedback to their actions |
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | Use concepts and language that are familiar and logical to the user |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | Allow users to make mistakes; give them options to undo and redo tasks |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | Follow conventions and make sure design is consistent across the platform |
| 5 | Error Prevention | Get rid of error-prone conditions and provide users with safety nets for high-cost errors |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | Minimize user's memory load by giving them suggestions and help in context |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Provide multiple ways to perform a task to make the platform accessible to all users |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Provide only relevant content and features |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | Tell users what the problem is and provide suggestions to fix it |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | Supply users with extra help to complete their tasks |
