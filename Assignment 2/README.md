## Survey
Access online survey [here](https://forms.gle/NiwNYUump8sFi9YE9)

*Note: I wasn't able to make a copy of the form that was attached in the assignment for some reason, so I created my own form closely resembling Professor Cho's form. I enabled both Professor Cho and our TA Alex to be editors on this form, so they should be able to access the answers, as well as information on the time/history of the form to double check dates, through the above link. As you should see, the form was submitted on Oct. 9, 2022.*
