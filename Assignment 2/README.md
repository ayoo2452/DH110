# Assignment 2: Pilot UT 

## Introduction
In the planning, you will have an introduction indicating the intention of UT and the methods.

### About MyLA311
MyLA311 is a mobile app (available on Apple App Store and Google PlayStore) created by the City of LA to help manage civil service requests. While the app primarily revolves around users being able to submit service requests (e.g. request grafitti removal, illegal parking, etc), the app also functions as a hub of information. For instance,users can be redirected to sites like LADWP and HCIDLA, on which users can pay utility and housing bills. Note that this app is targeted towards users who are based in Los Angeles, as the city services that users may request only range over the Los Angeles area.

### Purpose of usability testing 

The purpose of usability testing for MyLA311 is so that we can improve the app's overall user experience to better expedite the ease of browsing and submitting service requests. MyLA311 is an app that has the potential to help improve the quality of life for many LA citizens, and usability testing this app will help us make adjustments in the right directions so that we can better mitigate the local concerns that MyLA311 reports. In particular, this usability testing will give us a better insight on the following usability issues that we identified in an early study of the MyLA311 website: Error prevention; Flexibility and efficiency of use; Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors.

Amongst the three aforementioned heuristics, the biggest issue that I found while reviewing the app was that there was little to no error prevention for users entering information for a service request. A user could easily mistype their address, or give a bogus email, location, name, or all three. This issue is particularly distressing for an app that should need accurate information to filter out spam requests, as well as confirm and execute service requests. 

The three areas of concern are a part of the Neilsen Norman group's list of heuristics that are evaluated in user experience design. For more information on these heuristics, please see the [Neilsen Norman group's site](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). For a deeper read on my past review on MyLA311's user experience, with these heuristics as a basis, please visit my [DH 110 Assignment 1 readme file](https://github.com/ayoo2452/DH110/tree/main/Assignment%201)

### Process 


Introduction with the name of the web/app you test and what the web/app is about. 
Report the rationale behind of UT with the list of the usability issues you found from your heuristic reviews
Indicate that the purpose of the usability testing aims to find out how to improve the web/app from the user's perspective.
Describe the setting(where, portable minimalistic lab), equipment(computer, software)
Report that it is a pilot test (in order to test the setting and the materials).
Describe the process (ex. Background questions, pretest, posttest) and what was measured (ex. Ease of use)

## Survey
Access online survey [here](https://forms.gle/NiwNYUump8sFi9YE9)

*Note: I wasn't able to make a copy of the form that was attached in the assignment for some reason, so I created my own form closely resembling Professor Cho's form. I enabled both Professor Cho and our TA Alex to be editors on this form, so they should be able to access the answers, as well as information on the time/history of the form to double check dates, through the above link. As you should see, the form was submitted on Oct. 9, 2022.*
